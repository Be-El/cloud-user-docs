# de.NBI Cloud T端bingen
Welcome to the de.NBI Cloud site T端bingen. In the following we will
give you a basic introduction how to use our cloud site.

## General concept of the de.NBI Cloud T端bingen
A cloud like the one you will use here can be seen as computing resources which are available on demand.
You can get much more compute cores (CPU), main memory (RAM) and also storage capacity than you have
available on your own work station. The de.NBI Cloud T端bingen provides you the mentioned resources as an infrastructure (IaaS).
The available resources are used by starting Virtual Machines (VMs) on the provided computing machines.
You can start different virtual machines with different Linux based operating systems (OS) which consume different kind of
resources. The VMs can be customized on your own to fit your needs in the best way.
What you get is a computing infrastructure where you can run calculations or simulations with a flexible amount of resources
in your own computing environment (VM).
